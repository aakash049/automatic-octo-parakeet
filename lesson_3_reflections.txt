When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When many developers contribute to a single project but are separated by geographical means. also good as backup 
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because automatic update of repository can have versions which are likely incomplete hence broken

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are repositories which are sort of cloned from the original poster but they only go from github to github and have a reference to the
    original poster.
    clones are just copies from github to local or maybe local to local
    branches are different versions of the code eg. maybe new experimental features etc. 
          

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   I can do this even
    if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I
    want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the
    remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
